# 🚀 AXIS Studios v10.0: GOD MODE

**An AI-powered system for dominating the Shopify Theme Store.**

---

## 🎯 Overview

**AXIS Studios** is not just a collection of files; it's a comprehensive, semi-automated system designed to streamline the creation of high-quality, premium Shopify themes. It acts as a "50-person agency in a single brain," guiding you from market research and concept creation all the way to a successful Theme Store submission.

This system is built to enforce best practices in performance, accessibility, design, and security, ensuring that every theme created not only meets but exceeds Shopify's rigorous standards.

## ✨ Core Concepts

The system operates on a few core philosophies:

1.  **Performance by Default**: Every decision and generated piece of code prioritizes speed and a high Lighthouse score.
2.  **Accessibility is Law**: We adhere strictly to WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure themes are usable by everyone.
3.  **Uniqueness Sells**: Built-in checks and creative guidance prevent the creation of generic, "Dawn-like" themes.
4.  **AI as a Partner**: The system automates tedious tasks, allowing you, the visionary, to focus on strategy and creative direction.
5.  **Continuous Learning**: With the `Memory Log`, the system learns from its mistakes and gets smarter with every project.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into a series of modules (files), each with a specific responsibility. Here are the most important ones:

| File                                               | Purpose                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`axis_brain_v10.0_GOD_MODE.json`**               | **The Brain**: The central orchestrator that defines the entire workflow.      |
| `00_AXIS_SYSTEM_v8.0_TECH.txt`                     | **The Rulebook**: Defines the core technical standards for code.           |

| `17_AXIS_CONTEXT_ROUTER.json`                      | **The Accelerator**: Intelligently loads only relevant files to speed up the AI. |
| `18_AXIS_MEMORY_LOG.json`                          | **The Memory**: A database of past mistakes to prevent them from recurring.  |
| `24_AXIS_COMPETITOR_INTEL.json`                    | **The Spy**: A database of top competitor themes to guide strategy.        |
| `AXIS_COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION_v10.0_GOD_MODE.md` | **The Manual**: The complete documentation for the entire system.          |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start building your first theme, use the `START NEW THEME` command. This will kick off the automated market research and strategy phase.

**Example:**

```bash
> START NEW THEME "Zenith" --niche=furniture
```

The AI will then analyze the competition in the "furniture" niche and propose a unique concept for your theme, "Zenith".
