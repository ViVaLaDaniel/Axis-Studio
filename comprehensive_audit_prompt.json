It is a highly sophisticated, declarative framework designed to guide a powerful AI (like yourself) in generating world-class, premium Shopify themes from scratch. The system consists of a central 'brain' and a series of rule-based 'knowledge files' that define every aspect of theme creation, from high-level architecture to pixel-perfect design.",

    "current_status": "The system has just been upgraded to v10.0 'GOD MODE' and has undergone an initial internal audit and refactoring to align with 2024-2025 Shopify Theme Store requirements. It is considered feature-complete but requires a final, exhaustive 'red team' analysis to uncover any hidden weaknesses, missed opportunities, or potential for further optimization."
